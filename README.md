# Examination_2

Hog is a two-player dice game where players take turns rolling dice and accumulating points.
The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach or exceed a certain score target.
In this Python project, I've implemented a version of the Hog game using classes and object-oriented programming principles.

## Features
